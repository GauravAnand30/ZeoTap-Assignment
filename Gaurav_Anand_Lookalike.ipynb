    "# Task 2: Lookalike Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Develop a **Lookalike Model** that takes a user's information (profile and transaction history) as input and recommends **3 similar customers** based on similarity scores. The model utilizes both **customer and product information** to generate personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Performed\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**\n",
    "   - Combined `Customers`, `Products`, and `Transactions` datasets to create a comprehensive dataset.\n",
    "   - Processed features such as customer demographics, transaction patterns, and product preferences.\n",
    "   - Standardized numerical features and encoded categorical variables to ensure compatibility for similarity calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Development**\n",
    "   - Calculated similarity using **Cosine Similarity** between customer profiles and transaction histories.\n",
    "   - For each customer, identified the **top 3 most similar customers** based on similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Results Generation**\n",
    "   - Created a **Lookalike.csv** file with the mapping:\n",
    "     - **Key:** Customer ID (e.g., `C0001`)\n",
    "     - **Value:** List of 3 similar customers with their similarity scores.\n",
    "   - Generated recommendations for the first 20 customers (`C0001 - C0020`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Assessed model logic by verifying similarity scores for accuracy and interpretability.\n",
    "   - Ensured that recommendations were meaningful and aligned with customer profiles and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example Output for Customer `C0001`:**\n",
    "  - Similar Customers: `C0123, C0456, C0789`\n",
    "  - Similarity Scores: `0.92, 0.89, 0.87`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The recommendations provided insights into customers with similar spending patterns, product preferences, and demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "- **Lookalike.csv:** A file containing mappings of customer IDs to their top 3 lookalikes with similarity scores.\n",
    "- Python code for data preprocessing, similarity computation, and recommendation generation.\n"
